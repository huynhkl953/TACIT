\title{Identify Unique Markers for Subsets of Cell Types}
\usage{
find_unique_marker_for_subsets(signature)
}
\arguments{
\item{signature}{a matrix with cell types as rows and markers as columns.
The first column is expected to contain the cell type names.}
}
\value{
A list where the names are subset cell types and each element contains
the unique marker for that cell type, if one exists. If a cell type does not
have a unique marker or is not a subset, it will not appear in the list.
}
\description{
This function analyzes a signature matrix to identify unique markers for subset cell types.
It compares each cell type to potential parent cell types, identifying markers that are unique
to the subset cell type compared to its immediate parent.
